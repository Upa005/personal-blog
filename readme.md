# Personal Blog (WIP)
This is my new personal blog. Wordpress has become too cumbersome for my simple needs, so I made this simple NodeJS application to serve as my blog.

## Tech Stack
- [Node 6.7+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [ExpressJS framework](http://expressjs.com/en/resources/frameworks.html)
- [NeDB database](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb)
- [Handlebars templating engine](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
- [Marked markdown parser](https://github.com/chjj/marked)

## Setup & Development
- Clone this repo.
- Copy (and optionally modify) the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
- At the command line, run `$ npm install`.
- Then `$ npm start`.

The blog will be running on your localhost at the port specified in your `.env` file.
